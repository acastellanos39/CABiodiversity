A few scripts used to perform an analysis of Central American mammal biodiversity. The "Fixed" script is used to
calculate some of the biodiversity indices. "brt.determine" is used to parameterize the boosted regression trees in
the analysis. The RMarkdown as currently constructed contains GLMs, SARs, and BRTs analyzing all mammals and each 
order separately for four biodiversity indices. 
TO DO:
- remove GLMs and SARs as BRTs tell the story well enough and we aren't going in a methods heavy direction
- add in the other resolutions
- remove some variables
- put nice figure generation for manuscript all in a new script
